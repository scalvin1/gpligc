\section{Tools}

This is a small collection of Perl scripts, which can be useful for GPLIGC and OGIE users.

\subsection{loopviewer.pl}
The \texttt{loopviewer.pl} is a small script which can be used as a template to create an automatic show of a list of igc files.
It is intended to be used at gliding competitions to have a nice presentation of all flights. All pilots can enjoy every flight of the day, while having a nice cold beer in the briefing hangar (video-beamer!).
Therefore a list has to be created containing one line for every flight. Each line should contain the quoted path to the igc-file and a quoted information string: \\
\texttt{"c:$\backslash$path$\backslash$to$\backslash$file.igc"   "1. - Name - ASW20 - II - 610.34km - 102.3km/h - 1000pts"} \\
\texttt{"c:$\backslash$path$\backslash$to$\backslash$file2.igc"  "2. - Name - Ventus2 - I2 - 610.34km - 101.7km/h - 980pts"} \\
\texttt{...} \\
The configuration file should be set up to have some nice maps from the contest area, airspaces and whatever is needed. A good initial viewpoint position should be determined in some interactive run, subsequently the corresponding options can be changed in the \texttt{loopviewer.pl} script, which can be started with this simple call: \\
\texttt{loopviewer.pl  list} \\
where \texttt{list} is the file containing the above mentioned list.


\subsection{Garmin related tools}

Since I bought a Garmin Geko301, a few tools have been developed to use the Garmin's track logs etc.

I recommend to use \emph{gpspoint}  by Thomas Schank to do the data transfers to and from your Garmin device.
To handle the output from \emph{gpspoint} the following tools can be used.

\subsubsection{gpsp2igc.pl and gpsp2igcfile.pl}
\label{gpsp2igc}
This tool can convert the track log output from \emph{gpspoint} (\texttt{gpspoint -dt >tracklog.gpsp})
to something like an igc-file to be read by GPLIGC \& OGIE.

I use gpspoint as follows:

\texttt{gpspoint -p /dev/ttyS0 -dt | gpsp2igc.pl >out.igc}

gpsp2igcfile.pl creates IGC-file(s) with a filename corresponding to the date(s) of the recording.

\section{Installation}

\subsection{General Linux and Unix installation procedure}
\label{unix_install}
\label{linux_install}

This applies to all Linux and Unix operating systems.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Extract the archive: \\
\texttt{tar xvzf gpligc-version.tar.gz} \\
%\texttt{tar xvzf GPLIGC-version-os-arch.tar.gz}, in the case you're using a package containing binaries.\\
Change to the just created directory: \\
\texttt{cd gpligc-version}

\item Configure and build the software:\\
\texttt{./configure}\\
for options and details on configuring the build see README and the output of \texttt{./configure --help}

\item Build the software:\\
\texttt{make}

\item  \label{root}
Become root or run the next command using sudo.\\
\texttt{make install} %\quad or execute the script in the next step using \texttt{sudo}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%19 proofreading till here

%\item  start the installation script: (If you have security concerns, feel free to review the script before)\\
%\texttt{./install.sh} \\
%Some of the gpligc packages include binaries for the named platform.
%The install script will check them.
%If they don't work some parts of the software need to be compiled.
%However, you can chose to compile anyway, ignoring the shipped binaries.
%The src-package dont contain any binaries and need compilation in any case.

%If no binaries are found (or if the binaries don't work for some reason)
%The script will compile the  binaries (if this fails you will find more details in section ~\ref{compile}). \\
%The script will ask you for \\
%a) an installation prefix (/usr/local is recommended) \\
%If the script is allowed to write, it will install gpligc and ogie,
%files of installed earlier versions will be overwritten (if the same path is used).

\item copy the example configuration file
\texttt{.ogierc} (PREFIX/share/gpligc/) to your HOME directory
and edit it according to your needs (see section~\ref{config}).

% fixed
%\item \textbf{attention} re-using old \texttt{.gpligcrc} may cause problems, see section~\ref{bugs}. To be sure just delete your old configuration
%file: \texttt{rm \textasciitilde/.gpligcrc}.

\item Make sure that Gnuplot \cite{gnuplot} is installed and in the path.
GPLIGC will also work without Gnuplot,  but you will not be able to use the plotting features.

\item Make sure that the Perl/Tk \cite{perltk} module is installed

\item Read the documentation to learn how to use gpligc \& ogie

\end{enumerate}


%\subsubsection{Compiling ogie}
%\label{compile}
%OGIE should be compiled from within the install script. If that fails, you'll find some more information here.
%Furthermore, you'll find some information here, how you can compile a `mesa-only offscreen binary', which can be used on a headless server.

%The C/C++ parts (everything that needs compilation) of the ogie is located in the \texttt{openGLIGCexplorer} subfolder.

%\texttt{make help} will give you an overview of the available targets in the makefile.
%In general you should try to use one of the \emph{all-*} targets, closest matching your platform.
%If that fails, you need to modify the \texttt{Makefile} or contact the author.

%\paragraph{Compiling a statically linked binary (Mesa3D)}
%This is only needed if you're going to use ogie on a server for offscreen rendering (like the onlineplotter).

%Static linking with Mesa is possible and tested for linux and windows (cygwin) and requires at least \emph{Mesa 5.0.1}, (4.x seems not to work with ogie and offscreen rendering).
%\red{However, be warned it is a pain to get it linked.}

%\subparagraph{Mesa 7.0.3} works fine, as tested. If you need larger than 4096x4096 pictures (e.g. to create cool posters) you have to change
%the maximum sizes in \texttt{src/mesa/main/config.h} (in the mesa source code, before compiling mesa):
%\texttt{\#define~MAX\_WIDTH~32768} and \texttt{\#define~MAX\_HEIGHT~32768}.

%\subparagraph{Mesa 7.4.1} tested in May 2009. It worked for me as follows: download and unpack MesaLib and MesaGLUT-7.4.1. Change the maximum width and height as described above. Use \texttt{make linux-x86-64-static} or a similar target. After Mesa compiled, \texttt{cp lib64/lib*.a \textasciitilde/lib/} to put the static mesa-libs in your private \textasciitilde/lib/.

%For further details see the ogie Makefile. \texttt{MESAPATH, GLEX\_OSMESA} and \texttt{GLEX\_OSMESA\_WIN} are interesting bits.
%The osmesa target in the Makefile requires the static Mesa libraries in \textasciitilde/lib/

%\begin{verbatim}
%make clean
%make osmesa
%\end{verbatim}

%Compiling this on windows/cygwin is even more painful. However, I succeeded once, see comments in the Makefile.
%\begin{verbatim}
%make clean
%make osmesa-win
%\end{verbatim}

%The binary, which will be build is called \emph{openGLIGCexplorer-mesa}.



%\subsection{OpenBSD}
%On OpenBSD platforms, you need to install the following packages: gmake, p5-Tk, gnuplot, jpeg, bash.
%You'll need the glut library too, which is not available as a packge, but from the ports.
%The install.sh script should be started with the bash shell: \\
%\texttt{sudo bash ./install.sh}

%\subsection{Gentoo Linux}
%Gentoo users may use the gpligc ebuild from the \emph{sunrise} overlay.\\
%Adding the sunrise overlay: \texttt{layman -a sunrise} (for details see gentoo/layman documentation)\\
%Installing gpligc: \texttt{emerge gpligc}


%\input{mcinstall.tex}

\input{winstall.tex}

%\subsection{Update installation}
%If you want to update from an earlier version, you can safely use the install-scripts. Executable files will be replaced.
%Your data and configuration files will not be overwritten.
%But be sure to use the same paths for installation and symbolic links as in the previous installation, otherwise you my have conflicting installations.


\subsection{Additional Perl modules}
For best experience with gpligc you should install the following Perl modules:\\

\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{Image::ExifTool} \quad needed for photo-locator and geo-tagging. See \cite{exiftool}.
 \item \texttt{Imager} \quad needed for the new (1.9) map-feature. See \cite{imager}.
\end{itemize}

there are (at least) two ways of installing Perl modules

\subsubsection{manually} You should go to the CPAN \cite{cpan} and search for the modules, download and install them.
 After downloading the archive(s), it takes the usual three commands: \\
\texttt{perl Makefile.PL} \\
\texttt{make} \\
\texttt{make install}   (as root)\\


\subsubsection{using the CPAN.pm module} If the cpan module isn't configured yet, this can be done interactively or even automated during this process. \\
\texttt{perl -MCPAN -e shell} \\
then enter \\
\texttt{install Image::ExifTool}\\
at the cpan prompt.
